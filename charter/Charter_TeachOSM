The scope of the TeachOSM project is:
  * To promote the adoption and use of OpenStreetMap to teach geography
  * To develop a set of tools for educators and instructors that enable them to use OpenStreetMap to teach geography and mapping technique.
  * To support congruent educational initiatives of the OpenStreetMap US community.
  * To augment the work of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team Training Working Group and extend the vocational education and training efforts of HOT.

Operational Practices
---------------------

The tools/means by which TeachOSM working group will collaborate include:

* TeachOSM will publish all meeting notes publicly to the TeachOSM list as well as to the OpenStreetMap wiki.
* Routine, day-to-day conversations will be held on a subchannel of the OpenStreetMap US Slack channel.

These tools may be revised as the technical environment evolves. However, all decisions of the group will be posted publicly.
