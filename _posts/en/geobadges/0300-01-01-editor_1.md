# Instructions for obtaining the OpenStreetMap Editor I Geobadge

At the end of this course, you should be able to make basic edits in OpenStreetMap.

This course begins with an overview of the OpenStreetMap website and continues with instructions on how to add your features to OpenStreetMap.

## Getting familiar with the OpenStreetMap website

To get familiar with the OpenStreetMap website, take the walk-through over at [LearnOSM](https://github.com/hotosm/learnosm/blob/gh-pages/_posts/en/beginner/0200-12-27-start-osm.md). Return here when you get to the ['Adding Your First Points'](http://learnosm.org/en/beginner/start-osm/#adding-your-first-points) section.

### How geographic features are represented on a map
Everything on the map is represented by one of three shapes: either points, lines, and polygons. 

#### Points
A point can be used to represent a simple feature such as a shop, a tree, a fire hydrant, or your local coffee shop. Return to the [Point digitzing instructions]((http://learnosm.org/en/beginner/start-osm/#adding-your-first-points) on the LearnOSM site. 

#### Lines (or Ways)
Lines are used to represent linear features such as roads, rivers, paths, and runways. [Line digitizing instructions]

#### Polygons (or closed ways)
Polygons are used to represent area features, such as building footprints, boundaries, land uses, and so on. [Polygon digitizing instructions]
