### How geographic features are represented on a map
..Everything on the map is represented by one of three shapes: either points, lines, and polygons.

#### Points
....A point can be used to represent a simple feature such as a shop, a tree, a fire hydrant. [Point digitzing instructions]

#### Lines (or Ways)
....Lines are used to represent linear features such as roads, rivers, paths, and runways. [Line digitizing instructions]

#### Polygons (or closed ways)
....Polygons are used to represent area features, such as building footprints, boundaries, land uses, and so on. [Polygon digitizing instructions]
