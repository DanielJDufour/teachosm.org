## Instructions for obtaining the OpenStreetMap Editor I Geobadge

#### At the end of this course, you should be able to make basic edits in OpenStreetMap.

All those things you want to map, that is, all of those _geographic_features_ are represented by three shapes: points, lines, and polygons.

## Points
A point can be used to represent a simple feature such as a shop, a tree, a fire hydrant. [Point digitzing instructions]

## Lines (or Ways)
Lines are used to represent linear features such as roads, rivers, paths, and runways. [Line digitizing instructions]

## Polygons (or closed ways)
Polygons are used to represent area features, such as building footprints, boundaries, land uses, and so on. [Polygon digitizing instructions]
