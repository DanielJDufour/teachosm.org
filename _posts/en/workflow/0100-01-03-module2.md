# STEP 2: Assigning the work
## Assigning the work
Assigning the work to your group can be done in two ways. The first method is to assign work by theme or feature, say a quota of infrastructure to trace (i.e. 50 buildings, and/or 50 roads per student). The second method is to assign work by geography. One can assign designated cells (bounding box) to each student, or, a combination of both of these methods.  
The creation of cells is done through OSM Tasking Manager (OSM TM) and is explained in the next section. 

## TeachOSM Tasking Manager
In addition to the OpenStreetMap website, we make use of a tasking tool called [TaskingManager](http://tasks.teachosm.org). The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) developed the Tasking Manager as a tool to coordinate collaborative mapping efforts for disaster-affected areas. 

A TeachOSM instance of the tasking manager has been deployed to allow for similar collaborative efforts in a classroom setting. Class instructors will need project manager rights on the TeachOSM TaskingManager website to set up a “task” or assignment. Setting up a task will involve outlining the study area, segmenting the area to be mapped, and assigning these segments to students. Visit the [TeachOSM TaskingManager](http://tasks.teachosm.org/) site to explore the tool. and to request administrative rights. To request project manager privileges, please email info@teachosm.org

We will go through this tool in detail in the following section.

### Working with the Tasking Manager
Once you've determined your study area, you’ll have to create a new "task" in the TeachOSM TM.  This task will provide the students with geographic location, cell assignments and instructions.  

1. Go to [TeachOSM TaskingManager](http://tasks.teachosm.org/) and log in using your OSM credentials.

2. Under your username, select 'New Project'

3. You will now see the job creation interface:

4. You will be given the option to draw your study area freehand, or, to import a GeoJSON or KML file (we will proceed with the "draw" option for our demo)

5. Zoom to the location of your study area (this takes a little time and practice), once satisfied with your position, click on the "Draw" button, and draw a boundary around your study area.

6. You must decide if you want the task to be divided into regular grid cells, or irregular geometries

7. Choose your cell or tile size from from the selection bar (the default is medium).  Sizes range from extra small to extra large (XS - XL). XL covers more area per tile and XS covers less area per tile.  Avoid creating very large tiles. Smaller more manageable tiles are potentially less daunting to students and break the area of interest into more manageable chunks.

8. It is important to populate the task with a a job description (a backstory to the mapping project), and specific instructions for the participants (like what items need to be traced; roads, rivers, buildings etc.) - even if this a reiteration of information already presented in class.  This space should include perhaps include a note stating the task was created as part of a class project and ask those not involved with the class to refrain from editing in this area.

### Sample Task Description for the Tasking Manager
As you walk through the task creation, you will be prompted to create both your task description (a backstory to the mapping project), and specific instructions for the participants (like what items need to be traced; roads, rivers, buildings, etc.)

This is a sample task descrition:

This is a simple sample of task insructions:

There are also tabs to include extra information, such as specific imagery sources (other than Bing), identification of priority areas, and designation of specific allowed users. Information for these tabs is optional. 



### Keeping the work equitable
There are two key things to keep in mind while assigning the work: 1) equitable division of labour and 2) sufficient time for completion.  


There are two main ways we assign a "quota" to our students
  1) Assign a specific numbers of "nodes" to be traces, let's say 1000 nodes
      OR
  2) Use the "assigned cells" method built into the Tasking Manager

Using the "assigned cells" method exclusively will require additional work on behalf of the instructor as they must determine the difficulty level assocated with each cell, and then assign each cell individuall to the students. 
Instructors can set a high/medium/low designation on the density/difficulty level for each cell as some cells will have more traceable infrastructure than others.  
To do this, the grid of cells created in OSM TM will have to be exported to a desktop GIS application where the grid can be overlaid on imagery to make the difficulty determination.  This function is not available in TeachOSM TM.

If using the quota option, students will log into TeachOSM TM using their own OSM account credentials, and choose a cell in which to start tracing. They keep track of their individual quota using their personal OSM account, or, an alternate tool such as [Overpass Turbo](http://overpass-turbo.eu/) (more information on how to use this for monitoring and grading later).
