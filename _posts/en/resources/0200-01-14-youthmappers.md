## Youthmappers
Youthmappers is an international network of student organizations comitted to mapping both their communities and unmapped areas within USAID programming regions using the Openstreetmap platform. Youthmappers is a project of the Mapping for Resiliance University Consortium Grant, funded by the Geocenter at [USAID](https://www.usaid.gov/). 
Capitalizing on web-based open geospatial technologies, Youthmapper's mission is to cultivate a generation of young leaders to create resilient communities and to define their world by mapping it.
